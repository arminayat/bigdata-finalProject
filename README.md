# A real time BigData system for analysis of online Persian Twitter data

## Decription:

This Project is a group work with [Armin Ayatollahi](https://github.com/arminayat), [Zahra Habibzadeh](https://github.com/zaha2020) [Yara M. Bahram
](https://github.com/yaramohamadi), [mohammad-nili](https://github.com/mohammad-nili). in this project we used online Persian Twitter data for Designing a real-time system. 

For analyzing the content of Persian tweets, we developed a complete data processing pipeline, starting with stream data collection, prepocessing and maintaining the data, sending it to Elastic Search, processing and storing hashtag/channel history in Cassandra, saving real-time statistics in Redis, Performing real-time forecasting with Spark, statistical analysis of data with Superset/Clickhouse, and visualizations using Flask, React, and Kibana front-ends. the centrality of the data transfer was with Kafka.
